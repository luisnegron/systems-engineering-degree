# 🎓 Systems Engineering Degree  

This repository documents my journey through the **Systems Engineering Degree** at **Universidad Nacional de Loja (UNL)**.  
It includes **notes, code, projects, exercises, and resources** organized by the official curriculum (2013 adjusted syllabus).  

The repository is structured by **cycles (semesters)**, and each subject has its own folder with related materials.  
Content is available in **English and Spanish**.
